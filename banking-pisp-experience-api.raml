      This endpoint returns short-lived paymentId (key under which info about payment is stored in the PISP) and signingKey
      (used by merchant to sign the payment JWT token, also used by PISP to sign the response back to the merchant's URL defined in the payment token)

/initiate:
  description: |
    Initiates payment to payee from consumer. Before transfer of funds can be processed, customer authentication and consent must occur. A nonce will be used to prevent replay attacks and inadvertent duplicate transfers.

    The payee information is provided to the API as a JWT token with the set of payment claims. The JWT token (https://jwt.io/introduction/) is signed with the client secret of the registered app to ensure that it is not tampered with.

    This endpoint redirects to the configured authorization server where user is authenticated.
